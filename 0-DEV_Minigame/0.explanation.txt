This item allows the player to play mini arcade games on the server.
the classic cartridges are minigames like snake, mario in order to play during the farm or the moments without roleplay

(the one already created are the games available online)


Those resembling the gameboy camera would serve as an augmented reality mini game.

Many servers offer recreational racing or gunfight tools, without worrying about rp consistency, available at the touch of a button.

these cartridges would be used (depending on the cartridge) to create car races, obstacle courses, gunfights, lazertags...


To make it more practical, either you would have to add them once in your "exsorbeo gameboy" with a menu in the gameboy with all the games available (and be able to eject the cartridge to find it in your inventory)

Either keep it in a sub-menu of the inventory dedicated to the document for example
